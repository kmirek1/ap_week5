# a function allows us to bundle sode into
# reusable blocks, making it easier to manage
# and understand. By defining functions, we can 
# avoid code duplication and enhance readability.

# define a function 
def problem1():
    # pass # i put pass here to avoid syntax error

    # Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
    # Basic Indexing:
    magic = 'abracadabra'
    # a. Retrieve the 5th character.
    print(magic[4])
    # b. Retrieve the second to last character.
    print(magic[9])
    # c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.
    print(magic[4])
